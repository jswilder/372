known issues:
    1) On the Mac OS, the Frames open in the bottom left of the screen. This doesn't happen on Windows or Linux OS
    2) Also on the Mac OS, the gameBoardFrame stretches to fit the screen. This doesn't happen on Windows or Linux OS
    3) Not an issue but on Mac and Linux OS, the font "showcard Gothic" does not exist so it changes the look slightly,
            nothing game breaking
